# ======================================================================
# There are 5 questions in this test with increasing difficulty from 1-5
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative
# to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score much less
# than your Category 5 question.
# ======================================================================
#
# Computer Vision with CNNs
#
# This task requires you to create a classifier for horses or humans using
# the provided dataset. 
#
# Please make sure your final layer has 2 neurons, activated by softmax 
# as shown. Do not change the provided output layer, or tests may fail.
#
# IMPORTANT: Please note that the test uses images that are 300x300 with 
# 3 bytes color depth so be sure to design your input layer to accept
# these, or the tests will fail.
