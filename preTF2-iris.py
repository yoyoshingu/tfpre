# ======================================================================
# There are 5 questions in this test with increasing difficulty from 1-5
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative
# to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score much less
# than your Category 5 question.
# ======================================================================
#
# Basic Datasets question
#
# For this task you will train a classifier for Iris flowers using the Iris dataset
# The final layer in your neural network should look like: tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
# The input layer will expect data in the shape (4,)
# We've given you some starter code for preprocessing the data
# You'll need to implement the preprocess function for data.map

# =========== 합격 기준 가이드라인 공유 ============= #
# val_loss 기준에 맞춰 주시는 것이 훨씬 더 중요 #
# val_loss 보다 조금 높아도 상관없음. (언저리까지 OK) #
# =================================================== #
# 문제명: Category 2 - iris
# val_loss: 0.14
# val_acc: 0.93
