# ======================================================================
# There are 5 questions in this test with increasing difficulty from 1-5
# Please note that the weight of the grade for the question is relative
# to its difficulty. So your Category 1 question will score much less
# than your Category 5 question.
# ======================================================================
#
# Basic Datasets Question
#
# Create a classifier for the MNIST dataset
# Note that the test will expect it to classify 10 classes and that the 
# input shape should be the native size of the MNIST dataset which is 
# 28x28 monochrome. Do not resize the data. Your input layer should accept
# (28,28) as the input shape only. If you amend this, the tests will fail.
#

# =========== 합격 기준 가이드라인 공유 ============= #
# val_loss 기준에 맞춰 주시는 것이 훨씬 더 중요 #
# val_loss 보다 조금 높아도 상관없음. (언저리까지 OK) #
